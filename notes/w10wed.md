# Week 10 Wednesday COMP-320
Designing the worst programming language.

Ideas:
- lead with lowercase then rest uppercase when normally it would be the otherwise around
- No ASCII characters (except for spaces and tabs)
  - Numbers are done with emojis
- Program all on one line.
- Tab character `\t` starts and ends comments.
- No loops or ifs, only GOTOs
- Compiled
- Garbage collection done like the IRS: it knows what should be garbage collected but make you do it
- Object-orientated
- Every statement ends with "please;"
  - Return statement ends with "thank you;"


MAIN{PRINT "hello world" PLEASE;  THIS IS A COMMENT }
