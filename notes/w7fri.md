# Week 7 Friday COMP-320
## Jay Follow Up Activity: What would we add?
For loops.
- In order to just add, you need to declare loop variables at the beginning of the program.
- Implementation wise, we would just transform a for loop into a while loop.

Declaring variables in the middle of the program.

Operator Predence:
- It appears that handled in the first pass?
- Since our expressions are put into prefix, we don't need order of operations.
- There is no good example of how the first pass would handle a statement like `x = 1 + 2 * 2`.

Lists
- Start with C-like lists of set size.
- A statement like `int[4] list` would be initialized as `("list", [0,0,0,0])`.
