# Week 1 Monday
## Notes
Going over syllabus and course introduction.

There will be presentations on programming languages given by students.

### Three Major Language "Paradigms"
- Procedural
- Object Oriented
- Functional

There do exist other categories but these are the main 3.

Class will give experience with a functional language (LISP and Haskell).

### Reasons Sebesta gives for studying Concepts of Programming Languages:
To give you:
- Increased capacity to express ideas
- Improved background for choosing an appropriate language
- Increased ability to learn new languages
- Better understanding of the significance of implementation:
  - why languages are designed the way they are
  - ability to use a language more intelligently
  - help with debugging, become more efficient
- Another reason is to benefit the CS community (or at least 1 employer)


### Categorizing Languages The Class Has Used At Least Once
Procedural: `C`, MIPS, Scratch, `FORTRAN`, `COBOL`, Pascal

Object-Orientated: Java, `C++`, `C#`, Smalltalk, Objective-C

Functional: Haskell, LISP/Scheme

Multi-Paradigm: Python, Javascript, TypeScript, Switch, PHP, Ruby

Other: HTML, R, Markdown, LaTeX, SQL, `bash`, `sh`, perl

### Why Our Teams Icon is a Set of Gears
Shifting between paradigms (think manual transmission in a car).
Takes a bit to learn how to shift gears and paradigms.
