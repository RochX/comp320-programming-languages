# Week 3 Reflective Journal Entry

**Xavier Silva, 1-28-2024**

## Things I learned this week from the readings and/or videos:

 > This week learned about the basics of Haskell.
  I found the way Haskell defines functions to be very intuitive, especially coming from a mathematical background.
  The pattern matching makes it easy to consider each case of what we want the function to do.
  I like this way of defining functions as we don't have to create the pattern checking with `if` statements like you would have to do in other non-functional languages.



## How the concepts from this week apply to:
 ### Java (or Python, if you prefer)

 > One concept that applies to Java is the idea of testing our functions with a dedicated class.

 ### My Language: AProgrammingLanguage

 > TODO


## Reflection on the language(s) presented this week: Haskell
> I found Haskell to be a more interesting and intuitive language than Scheme.
  I found the reading of [Learn You a Haskell](https://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) to be very helpful for getting the basics down.
  Haskell feels like a powerful functional langauge that is easy to use. TODO FINISH

[You do not need to reflect on the presentation of your own language]

- Could include similarities and differences between language(s) presented this week and Java (or Python) and your own language.
- Could address how language(s) presented this week address the concepts introduced this week, and concepts discussed earlier in the quarter.

## Answers/Reflections regarding additional questions posed for this week:
One of the differences between Scheme and Haskell is whether operators such as + and == are infix or prefix. Give an advantage of each.

> The biggest advantage of prefix operators is that no parentheses are required in order to determine an order of operations.
  An advantage of infix operators is that it can be easier to read in many cases.

Pick at least one other difference between these two functional languages to discuss using the language evaluation criteria introduced in Chapter 1 (readability, writeability, etc.).

> TODO

What is lazy evaluation, and what is the connection to Haskell? (And why does that make the [xkcd Very Important Handout](https://xkcd.com/1312/) even funnier?)
