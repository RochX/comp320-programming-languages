**Title or Topic:**  Javascript


**Three things you learned from this presentation:**

- Developed to address the need for a scripting language that could add interactively to webpages.
- JavaScript has dynamic typing.
- JavaScript can be vulnerable to security threats.


**Things that seemed confusing, incomplete, or piqued your interest:**

- I would like to learn more about how JavaScript changed over time.


**Reflect: What impact, if any, has this presentation had on your understanding or perspective on the topic?**

 > This presentation made me briefly reflect upon how JavaScript is dynamically typed and how that can lead to difficult bugs to fix.
  Beyond that, I found there wasn't much more to reflect on from this presentation.


**Presentation strengths (strong content, clarity, visual presentation,
timing, humor, etc.)**

- The presentation gave a concise overview of JavaScript.


**Any presentation weaknesses or constructive suggestions:**

- While the presentation was concise, I think that it could've gone more in depth, given that the audience is the class.
