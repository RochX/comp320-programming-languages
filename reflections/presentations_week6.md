# Presentation Audience Reflective Response

As you create presentation responses, please move beyond summary to
reflection. For example, were any of the ideas new, or did they cause you
to think about some topic differently than you had before? What impact, if
any, did the video or presentation have on you?

## Simula
**Presenter's Name, Date of Presentation:**   Avery Brockington

**Title or Topic:**  Simula


**Three things you learned from this presentation:**

- Simula is related to ALGOL 60 for familiarity.
- Simula is the first programming language to implement object oriented programming.
- Simula can run "simulations" where there are set units of times.


**Things that seemed confusing, incomplete, or piqued your interest:**

- How the "simulations" in Simula can be used for more complex programs.


**Reflect: What impact, if any, has this presentation had on your
understanding or perspective on the topic?**

 > It's interesting to see what the earliest implementation of object oriented programming looks like.
  I can easily see the similarities to Java.


**Presentation strengths (strong content, clarity, visual presentation,
timing, humor, etc.)**

- The information was concisely presented well.


**Any presentation weaknesses or constructive suggestions:**

- It would've been nice to get some more understanding on why Simula has a steep learning curve.


## SmallTalk
**Presenter's Name, Date of Presentation:**   Quinn and Tim, 2-18-2024

**Title or Topic:**  Smalltalk


**Three things you learned from this presentation:**

- Smalltalk is purely object oriented.
- No form of control structures, opting for messages instead.
- Smalltalk uses a virtual runtime environment, similar to Java.


**Things that seemed confusing, incomplete, or piqued your interest:**

- How are programs written without control structures?


**Reflect: What impact, if any, has this presentation had on your
understanding or perspective on the topic?**

 > This presentation gave a good example of a pure object oriented langauge.
  The object oriented languages we are familiar with are typically also imperative languages, so seeing a language that is purely object oriented is interesting.


**Presentation strengths (strong content, clarity, visual presentation,
timing, humor, etc.)**

- Good content that was easy to understand.


**Any presentation weaknesses or constructive suggestions:**

- The pacing of the presentation was a little bit slow at times.
- It would've been nice to see some sort of code syntax highlighting in the code examples.
