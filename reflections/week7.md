# Week 7 Reflective Journal Entry

**Xavier Silva, 2-25-2024**

## Things I learned this week from the readings and/or videos:
 > One thing I learned this week was the different paradigms for passing parameters to functions.
  These include pass-by-value, pass-by-reference, pass-by-value-result, and pass-by-name.
  I found it interesting because upon reflection, many instances where I thought I was using pass-by-reference I was actually using pass-by-value (in Java primarily).


## How the concepts from this week apply to:
 ### Python
 > The idea of running Jay through an interpreter relates to Python because Python is an interpreted language.
 Because we are interpreting the language, we only need to consider what is coming next and nothing beyond that.
 Our Jay interpreter works like this, and Python to some extent works like this, though it has been highly optimized over the years due to its widespread use.

## Answers/Reflections regarding additional questions posed for this week:
### Talk about your experience with the Jay Interpreter and its relationship to the topics from Weeks 6 and 7.
I found my experience with the Jay Interpreter to be enjoyable once I got over the syntax with all of the custom types.
Because of how many types there are, at first it was annoying to figure out which type to use (e.g. deciding between `ValidValue` or `VarValue`).
After these annoyances, I found it easier to focus on writing the Jay Interpreter.
It certainly helped me understand the fundamental difference between expressions and state, which I hadn't really thought about much before the Jay Interpreter.

After finishing the project, I found the in-class discussion on what to add next to be quite intriguing.
My group had talked about what it would take to add for loops, declaring variables in the middle of the program, operator precedence, and lists.
I feel like if we were assigned to implement one or more of these features, I would already have ideas on how to implement it.
