**Presenter's Name, Date of Presentation:**   David Vargas and Jonah Beurkens, 2-12-2024

**Title or Topic:**  ALGOL


**Three things you learned from this presentation:**

- ALGOL was developed to address the need for a high-level programming language with precies syntax semantics.
- Many of the modern languages such as C and Java were influenced by ALGOL.
- ALGOL introduced strong typing, making way for strong semantics.


**Things that seemed confusing, incomplete, or piqued your interest:**

- Is there a reason that `:=` is used for assignment rather than `=`?


**Reflect: What impact, if any, has this presentation had on your
understanding or perspective on the topic?**

 > ALGOL looks more similar to the modern programming langauges than the other languages shown such as FORTRAN and COBOL.
  The strong typing in particular makes it easy see the similarity between it and modern languages.


**Presentation strengths (strong content, clarity, visual presentation,
timing, humor, etc.)**

- Strong visual clarity on the slides


**Any presentation weaknesses or constructive suggestions:**

- TODO
