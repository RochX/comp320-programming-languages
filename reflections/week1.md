# Week 1 Reflective Journal Enty

## New and Eye-Opening

Did any of the information from the book or videos this week surprise you?
There was probably at least something that was new, unexpected, or thought-tantalizing.

 > The biggest concept that surprised me was how functional programming languages don't have any form of state or variables.
 That seems like a huge limitation in what kind of programs one could write. Could one even write an interactive program (such as a game) in a functional language? Right now it seems like the answer would be no, but I also think there is something I am likely misunderstanding about programming languages.
 However, I do think these functional programming languages seem to be very well suited at doing mathematics and expressing complex mathematical ideas.


## Language Comparison (2 Languages I Know)

Specify two languages you are comparing.  Identify at least two language
features that are different in two languages you know. For each feature,
give a justification for the design choices made by each language. 

 > I will be comparing C++ and Python.
 One feature difference between these two languages is how C++ is a compiled language while Python is an interpreted language. 
 Since C++ was designed to be an extension to the C language, it has to be a compiled language. 
 C is a compiled language because it allows for efficient low-level code.
 C++ has high-level code that can be compiled to optimal code for the machine to run.
 Python was designed as an interpreted language in order to make it easy to quickly write and run code in an interactive environment.
 Another feature difference between these two languages is how C++ is a statically typed language while Python is a dynamically typed language.
 C++ is statically typed because it allows for the compiler to catch errors before the program is even run.
 It also allows the compiler to optimize code during compilation.
 Python is a dynamically typed language in order to give simple and less cluttered syntax. 
 It allows for code that is simple and easy to learn.
