# Final Reflective Journal Entry
## COMP-320

**Xavier Silva, 3-19-2024**

### Over the course of your career, you are likely to pick up a number of new languages, including scripting languages, special-purpose languages for interacting with specific software tools, new languages that haven't been dreamt of yet, and maybe even old languages to understand and update legacy code. Looking back at the concepts and specific languages that you have learned this quarter, and looking back at your weekly reflections, what have you learned that will help you pick up new languages in the future?

I would say that the biggest thing I've learned in this class is shifting between different paradigms and langauges.
I find that there is a certain mindset I need to be in whenever I'm writing in a particular language.
For example, when I'm writing Java, I'm thinking object orientated and about what the class hierarchy looks like, what methods I want the class to have, etc.
When I'm writing in React, I'm thinking about what components I need to have, how many components should I split something into, etc.
And when I'm writing in a functional langauge such as Haskell, I need to think recursively and think purely in functions without state.
All of these different programming languages have different design principles, syntax, and semantics that force me to think differently.

This quarter exposed me to many more different kinds of languages that I would have never seen before.
The blend of historical languages such as Fortran and COBOL while also including more modern languages such as Haskell, Javascript, and Rust have overall made me a more well-rounded programmer.
Understanding and being exposed to more languages will help me learn languages quicker because I can think about how they do or don't relate ("Oh, feature in language X is just like this feature in language Y, but slightly different because...").
The student presentations gave me a good glimpse at all of these languages that I had vaguely heard about before but had never personally investigated.

While not strictly related to the ideas from this class, another concept that I continued to improve on was using Git.
For this class I put all of my notes, programs, and reflections into one Git repository.
It was simple enough at the start when I was simply writing notes in markdown files, but over the course in the term it expanded to more complicated questions such as "Can I use Git with replit?" or "Can I put a Git repository inside another repository?".
I was able to answer both of them for myself (replit has a Git integration and an online command-line I can use and Git submodules allows for nested Git repos), but these were things I did beyond the class material in order to keep myself organized.
It is satisfying to look at my Git history and see that I have been consistent in keeping myself organized and keeping my commits small and steady, rather than committing many files at once.
This level of commitment to staying organized from the start has been super helpful as I know where everything is at all times.
I know that staying on top of my organization will make things much easier when I move on to new things such as a software development job or something similar.
