# Presentation Audience Reflective Response

As you create presentation responses, please move beyond summary to
reflection. For example, were any of the ideas new, or did they cause you
to think about some topic differently than you had before? What impact, if
any, did the video or presentation have on you?

**Title or Topic:**  Rust


**Three things you learned from this presentation:**

- Rust had the goal of being a memory efficient C-type language.
- Ownership rules in Rust allows the compiler to check for memory errors.
- Borrowing allows for pass-by-value and pass-by-reference within the same program.


**Things that seemed confusing, incomplete, or piqued your interest:**

- I would like to learn more about how steep the Rust learning curve is.
  Is it really a steeper learning curve than C?


**Reflect: What impact, if any, has this presentation had on your understanding or perspective on the topic?**

 > I've heard about Rust vaguely through its community and offhand posts I see online, but I had never really engaged with the language until this presentation.
  Seeing the language helps me understand why Rust has an almost cult-like following to it.


**Presentation strengths (strong content, clarity, visual presentation, timing, humor, etc.)**

- Content was clear, concise, and easy to understand.


**Any presentation weaknesses or constructive suggestions:**

- None I can think of.

**Title or Topic:**  Prolog


**Three things you learned from this presentation:**

- Prolog is a high-level programming language designed for logical reasoning tasks.
- Prolog is built of facts, rules, and queries.
- Prolog uses backtracking and recursion built-in in order to find solutions.


**Things that seemed confusing, incomplete, or piqued your interest:**

- I would like to learn more about how more complex programs are written in Prolog.
  I have little experience with logical programming, so I'm not sure what kind of problems logical programming is best suited for.


**Reflect: What impact, if any, has this presentation had on your understanding or perspective on the topic?**

 > Prolog has been my only experience with a logical programming language, so it is interesting to see how this paradigm works.
  I don't know how I would use this kind of programming language but it seems more suited for more niche uses, similar to how SQL is only used for databases.


**Presentation strengths (strong content, clarity, visual presentation, timing, humor, etc.)**

- Strong content that was easy to understand.


**Any presentation weaknesses or constructive suggestions:**

- Since this is a presentation recording rather than an in-class presentation, it may be wise to redo some parts to get rid of some longer pauses/stutters and pronounication issues.
