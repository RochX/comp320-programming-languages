# Presentation Audience Reflective Response

As you create presentation responses, please move beyond summary to
reflection. For example, were any of the ideas new, or did they cause you
to think about some topic differently than you had before? What impact, if
any, did the video or presentation have on you?

**Your Name, Today's Date:**   Xavier Silva, 2-4-2024

**Presenter's Name, Date of Presentation:**   Rowan and Derik, 2-4-2024

**Title or Topic:**  Fortran


**Three things you learned from this presentation:**

- Lower-level computing language used in numerical and scientific computing
- Compiled language
- Early development of Fortran was done on punch cards
- Type specification is mathematically based, using integers, real numbers, complex numbers, etc.


**Things that seemed confusing, incomplete, or piqued your interest:**

- How more complex mathematical objects and operations are done in Fortran, such as matrices and matrix multiplication.
- How input/output works, what is the purpose of the `*` in the statement `write (*,*)`?


**Reflect: What impact, if any, has this presentation had on your
understanding or perspective on the topic?**

 > The presentation was a great way to get a gentle introduction to what Fortran is about.
  I found it interesting to see how Fortran has a significant basis in mathematics.



**Presentation strengths (strong content, clarity, visual presentation,
timing, humor, etc.)**

- Strong visual clarity
- Good pacing


**Any presentation weaknesses or constructive suggestions:**

- It would've been nice to get a walkthrough of how a Fortran program works (perhaps using the Heron's formula program?).
