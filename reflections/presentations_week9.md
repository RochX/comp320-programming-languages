# Presentation Audience Reflective Response

As you create presentation responses, please move beyond summary to
reflection. For example, were any of the ideas new, or did they cause you
to think about some topic differently than you had before? What impact, if
any, did the video or presentation have on you?

**Your Name, Today's Date:**   Xavier Silva, 3-12-2024

**Presenter's Name, Date of Presentation:**   Farida and Vanessa, 3-12-2024

**Title or Topic:**  R


**Three things you learned from this presentation:**

- Interpreted language for statistical computing and data visualization.
- R supports data manipulation and data visualization for use with making statistical analysis.
- R has a relatively steep learning curve and has different structure than other standard programming languages such as Java or C.


**Things that seemed confusing, incomplete, or piqued your interest:**

- It would've been nice to get a description of what the `%>%` string does within R code. 
  It seems like it passes the most recent object to chain functional calls, but I'm not entirely sure.


**Reflect: What impact, if any, has this presentation had on your understanding or perspective on the topic?**

 > I see R as a language built for a very particular purpose.
  It is interesting to see as many of ideas that R lets us do could be done in other more general purpose langauges such as Java and Python or even C.
  The language is highly optimized for one kind of task, unlike most programming languages we first learn.


**Presentation strengths (strong content, clarity, visual presentation, timing, humor, etc.)**

- Presentation had a good visual clarity.
- Presentation was well done and concise.


**Any presentation weaknesses or constructive suggestions:**

- There was some sort of microphone clipping happening in Vanessa's parts which was slightly distracting from the content of the presentation.
